The Java Collections Framework is a collection of interfaces and classes which helps in storing and processing the data efficiently. This framework has several useful classes which have tons of useful functions which makes a programmer task super easy. A List is an ordered Collection. Lists may contain duplicate elements. Elements can be inserted or accessed by their position in the list, using a zero-based index. A Set is a Collection that cannot contain duplicate elements. There are three main implementations of Set interface: HashSet, TreeSet, and LinkedHashSet. HashSet, which stores its elements in a hash table, is the best-performing implementation; however it makes no guarantees concerning the order of iteration. TreeSet, which stores its elements in a red-black tree, orders its elements based on their values; it is substantially slower than HashSet. LinkedHashSet, which is implemented as a hash table with a linked list running through it, orders its elements based on the order in which they were inserted into the set. A Map is an object that maps keys to values. A map cannot contain duplicate keys. There are three main implementations of Map interfaces: HashMap, TreeMap, and LinkedHashMap. HashMap makes no guarantees concerning the order of iteration. TreeMap stores its elements in a red-black tree and orders its elements based on their values; it is substantially slower than HashMap. LinkedHashMap orders its elements based on the order in which they were inserted into the set.
